# UniversityFinder.API
This Web API groups universities by country. The implementation of this API follows all the REST API standards using ASP.NET Core 6

You can search either by university name or country. You can also add a univeristy if it has not been registered in the API or add any missing country and register one or more universitites under it. Feel free to use this API anyhow you like.
